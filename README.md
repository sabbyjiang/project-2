# Project 2

## Name of the App:
Recipe search for healthier living

## API: 
(Edamam Recipe API)[https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api]

## Overall:
The app is designed so that a user may be able to better search recipes, save dietary preferences so that recipes only within those parameters show up, and save recipes for future use. They should also be able to export them.


## Functionality
After creating an account and logging in, the user will be asked about their preferences. A list of suggestions for search words will then be given to them. The user can then search, save, and select recipes. 

#### Reach Goals: 
- Connect a second API which will be able to show them farmers markets in their area

- Be able to query the farmer's market to make sure they sell the same kind of ingredients

## Technology Intended to Use:
- Node.js, PSQL, jQuery, HMTL5, CSS
